        The BBC likes nothing better than to hijack a popular, cosy entertainment and turn it into propaganda for its radical opinions.



        When ‘Call the Midwife’ first began it swiftly gained an audience because of its reassuring backgrounds ,likeable and admirable  nuns, midwives, doctors and an old-fashioned working class district on the edge of change.



        But then it developed an agenda, politically correct (of course), making use of its well-liked and attractive actors, such as Helen George, to make various points.



        I’m old enough and suspicious enough to think that a lot of this is false to the period it claims to portray. But let it pass. What I cannot put up with is the repeated propaganda for abortion on demand.



        The programme has now done this twice. In 2013 it featured a gruesome back street abortion before the watershed. Last week it depicted another one, in which a happily-married mother of two was shown as being so upset at becoming pregnant that she sought to destroy the baby (this time the crime was unseen) in some dingy kitchen.



        Speaking like a 21st century feminist, this 1960s woman was shown saying ‘It isn't what I wanted. Are women not allowed to want or not want things? I thought it was going to be different for us, that we were going to be able to choose.’ Note the word ‘choose’, the abortionists’ euphemism for the choice they support – killing the unwanted baby.



        She then died of the resulting infection. Everyone involved, from the doctor who had refused to arrange a legal abortion, to the midwives who knew her, to the supposedly devout nuns, was shown regretting that she couldn’t have had an abortion.  ‘Trixie’, played by Helen George, was shown making a pro-abortion speech to the police: ‘We see this all the time. Young, young girls, exhausted older women, mothers who don’t know when their next penny or next beating is coming from, and others who want to take control of their bodies and their lives. And all we can do is pat them on the hand and say “you’ll manage, everybody does”. But not everybody does. Not everybody believes us. So sorry. I can’t help you. I’m even more sorry that I couldn’t help her.’ Not one doctor, nun or nurse defended the law against abortion.





        Actually, I would guess most nurses, midwives and doctors, and all nuns, were still very much against abortion at that time. It had in fact been legal under very restricted circumstances since   a case in 1938, where a brave doctor, Aleck Bourne, turned himself in after aborting a young girl who had been gang-raped by soldiers, and was acquitted. Bourne ever afterwards refused to do another abortion, and opposed the 1967 Act which hugely liberalised it.



        As for ‘seeing it all the time’, the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists in the 1960s flatly refuted pro-abortion claims that there were tens of thousands of illegal backstreet operations, and huge numbers of deaths resulting. They said that the number of such deaths averaged 50 a year throughout England and Wales. Regrettable and tragic, no doubt. But instead we now have 180,000 babies killed every year in legal abortions. Is this better?  There was, after all, another solution to such problems. In 1968, there were almost 25,000 adoptions a year, by parents who very much wanted children.  Now it’s nearer 5,000 a year. If programmes such as ‘Call the Midwife’ are going to editorialise on this subject, let them at least give both sides.
